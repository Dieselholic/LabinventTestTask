# Local Deployment with Docker

To run the application locally, we'll leverage Docker Desktop. I've prepared a `docker-compose.yml` file, so most of the setup work is already done.

## Steps to Deploy:

1. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Make sure to install the appropriate version for your operating system. For Windows users, the installation link is [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

2. **Configure Docker Compose File:**
   - Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and locate line 10. Replace the `FILEPATH` placeholder with the path to the folder where your XML files will be stored.

3. **Open Command Prompt (CMD) in Repository Root:**
   - It's tough, but I'm sure you'll do well.

5. **Deploy Containers:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```cmd
     docker compose up -d
     ```
   This command initiates the container deployment. Be patient, as the process might take some time.

6. **Check Deployed Containers:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```cmd
     docker ps
     ```
   Note down the name of the container where RabbitMQ is deployed.

7. **Apply Configuration to RabbitMQ:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```cmd
     docker exec -d [RABBITMQ_CONTAINER_NAME] sh /usr/local/bin/init.sh
     ```
     - Replace `[RABBITMQ_CONTAINER_NAME]` with the actual name of your RabbitMQ container.
     - `/usr/local/bin/init.sh` is the script name inside the container. Adjust if necessary.

   This command configures RabbitMQ by creating the required users for the application.

8. **Access Database Entries:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8080` to explore the database entries generated by the microservice.

9. **You're Done!**
   - Congratulations! You're all set up and ready to enjoy the application.

Feel free to explore and modify the setup according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the documentation or seek assistance in the project community.

Enjoy your delightful experience! ðŸ˜Š
