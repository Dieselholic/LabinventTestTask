## Terms of the task
Located in [this file](test_task(C#).pdf).

## Steps to Deploy:

0. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Make sure to install the appropriate version for your operating system. For Windows users, the installation link is [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

1. **Configure Docker Compose File:**
   - Open the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file and locate [line 13](docker-compose.yml#L13).
   - If you don't have your own directory with .xml files, you can delete this line and uncomment the line following it with the path to the test data.
   - Otherwise replace the `FILEPATH` placeholder with the path to the folder where your XML files will be stored.
      - After the changes, it should look something like this(for Windows):
   ```yml
     volumes:
        - C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\XML\:/app/data/XMLStorage
   ```

2. **Open Command Prompt (CMD) in [Repository Root](.):**
   - It's tough, but I'm sure you'll do well.

3. **Deploy Containers:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```
   This command initiates the container deployment. Be patient, as the process might take some time.

4. **Check Deployed Containers:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     docker ps --format {{.Names}}
     ```
   Copy the name of the container in which RabbitMQ is deployed.

5. **Apply Configuration to RabbitMQ:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     docker exec -d [RABBITMQ_CONTAINER_NAME] sh /usr/local/bin/init.sh
     ```
   This command configures RabbitMQ by creating the required users for the application.
     - Replace `[RABBITMQ_CONTAINER_NAME]` with the actual name of your RabbitMQ container.
     - `/usr/local/bin/init.sh` is the full path to the script inside the container.
   
      >**If you want to change the script path, change the following lines and re-execute the steps starting from step 3**
      >- [Line 44 in docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml#L44)
      >- [Line 3 in Dockerfile.RabbitMQ](Docker/Dockerfile.RabbitMQ#L3)
      >- [Line 5 in Dockerfile.RabbitMQ](Docker/Dockerfile.RabbitMQ#L5)

6. **Access Database Entries:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8082` to explore the database entries generated by the microservice.

7. **You're Done!**
   - Congratulations! You're all set up and ready to enjoy the application.


## Changing Applications Settings

You have the flexibility to modify various application properties by editing the `appsettings.json` files for the following services:

- **FileParserService:** [appsettings.json](LabinventTestTask.FileParserService/appsettings.json)
- **DataProcessorService:** [appsettings.json](LabinventTestTask.DataProcessorService/appsettings.json)

Most of the customization options are self-describing.

#### Example Customizations:

1. Enable or Disable File Logging for the DataProcessorService:
   - In the `DataProcessorService` settings file, modify the ["IsFileLoggingEnabled" parameter in line 4](LabinventTestTask.DataProcessorService/appsettings.json#L4).

2. Configure the xml file directory check interval for the FileParserService:
   - In the `FileParserService` settings file, change the number of milliseconds in the ["ServiceTimeoutMs" parameter in line 10](LabinventTestTask.FileParserService/appsettings.json#L10).

Feel free to explore and tailor the customization options according to your needs.
